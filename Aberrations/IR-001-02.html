    <h1>Aberration Research Institute</h1>
    <h2>Incident Report: IR-001-02</h2>
    
    <strong>ID #:</strong> ABR-001<br>
    <strong>Codename:</strong> Nephological Entity<br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Date of Incident:</h3> [REDACTED]<br>
    <h3>Location:</h3> Aberration Research Institute (ARI) global headquarters.<br>
    <h3>Involved Personnel:</h3> Researcher Dr. [REDACTED], Security Officer [REDACTED], and Technician [REDACTED].<br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Summary of Incident:</h3>
    <p>
        At approximately [REDACTED] hours, the climate control system within the Nephological Entity's containment cell malfunctioned due to a technical glitch, inducing an unforeseen temperature rise. As a result, the Nephological Entity underwent a sudden transformation from its stable state to a cirrus cloud form. The entity began floating near the top of its cell, its coloration altering to a soft orange-pink hue, reminiscent of a sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. [REDACTED], who was monitoring the entity at the time, immediately recognized the alteration in behavior and initiated containment protocols. Security Officer [REDACTED] and Technician [REDACTED] were alerted and reached the containment cell within minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The containment cell's emergency cooling system was activated, stabilizing the temperature and aiding in the return of the Nephological Entity to its standard form. After approximately 20 minutes, the entity's coloration and cloud formations indicated a state of calm.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Resultant Damage:</h3>
    <p>
        No personnel were harmed during the incident. Minor damages to the containment cell's climate control interface were noted, which were later repaired by ARI technicians.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Recommendations and Actions Taken:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A complete inspection of the climate control system has been ordered to prevent a recurrence of such malfunctions.</li>
        <li>Additional backup systems have been installed to swiftly counteract any further unexpected shifts in temperature.</li>
        <li>Staff training on quick emergency response tailored to the Nephological Entity has been scheduled to ensure optimal response times and procedures in future events.</li>
        <li>Routine communication and comfort checks with the Nephological Entity have been increased to twice daily to monitor its well-being more closely.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
    <p>
        This incident reaffirms the importance of continuous monitoring and the maintenance of containment systems. A dedicated task force has been proposed to analyze and develop improvements for all containment systems across ARI facilities.
