        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>ID #:</strong> ABR-003</p>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Codename:</strong> "The Unseen Stalker"</p>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Threat Level:</strong> III Hazardous</p>
        <p class="aberration-section description-text"><strong>Description:</strong> ABR-003, designated as "The Unseen Stalker," is an imperceptible entity that commences its pursuit of an individual, herein termed the target, under conditions yet to be fully comprehended. The entity predominantly initiates tracking during nocturnal hours, with occasional deviations noted.</p>
<p class="aberration-section description-text">ABR-003 exhibits its presence by shadowing the target silently, adhering to a consistent and measured pace. Its invisibility is accompanied by the elicitation of an eerie, tingling sensation at the nape of the target's neck, often accompanied by feelings of apprehension and unease. Pursuit by ABR-003 ceases when the target takes refuge within an enclosed space, such as a room or a vehicle.</p>
<p class="aberration-section description-text">Upon the target's seclusion, ABR-003 communicates its presence through a soft, repetitive knocking on the door. Subsequently, ABR-003 mimics the voice of an entity known to the occupants of the room, employing phrases and speech patterns aimed at persuading the occupants to grant access.</p>
<p class="aberration-section description-text">In the presence of bystanders accompanying the target, a compelling inclination to open the door prevails, rendering resistance arduous, even when apprised of ABR-003's existence. The sole known method of resistance is the utilization of specialized earplugs, attuned to block the specific auditory frequency associated with ABR-003.</p>
<p class="aberration-section description-text">The outcome of granting entry to ABR-003 remains uncertain, as no individuals who have done so have been subsequently located alive. A prevailing hypothesis posits that ABR-003 wields lethal capabilities or induces conditions culminating in fatality upon entry.</p>
      
      <br>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Containment Protocols:</strong> The direct containment of ABR-003, denominated as "The Unseen Stalker," is currently deemed infeasible due to its elusive nature. ARI personnel are tasked with investigating and responding to reports consistent with ABR-003-like occurrences. A disinformation strategy is implemented to discredit such accounts, attributing them to urban legend or collective delusion, thereby preserving confidentiality and averting public alarm.</p>

<p class="aberration-section">In the event an individual is verified to be under pursuit by ABR-003, immediate relocation to a secure ARI facility is mandated. On-site personnel in close proximity to the target shall receive thorough briefings on ABR-003's attributes and shall be equipped with specialized earplugs to counteract the entity's influence.</p>

<p class="aberration-section">Subsequent to the manifestation of ABR-003, the afflicted locale must be secured and subjected to thorough cleansing by a designated response team.</p>
