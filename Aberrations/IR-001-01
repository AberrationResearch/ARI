    <h1>Aberration Research Institute</h1>
    <h2>Incident Report: IR-001-01</h2>

    <h3>ID #: ABR-001</h3>
    <h3>Codename: Nephological Entity</h3>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> [REDACTED]</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Aberration Research Institute (ARI) initial containment facility.</p>
    <p><strong>Involved Personnel:</strong> Field Agent [REDACTED], Lead Researcher Dr. [REDACTED], and Assistant Researcher [REDACTED].</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Summary of Incident:</h3>
    <p>During the initial containment of the Nephological Entity, a series of unforeseen atmospheric changes rapidly occurred within its provisional containment cell. The entity manifested a heavy rainstorm, causing a rapid build-up of water within the cell. This sudden change was presumed to be a result of the entity's distress during its first containment experience.</p>
    
    <p>Field Agent [REDACTED] was present in the vicinity and responded promptly to the incident, initiating emergency drainage systems. Dr. [REDACTED] and Assistant Researcher [REDACTED], who were observing the containment process, noted that the entity's cloud formations shifted to a darker hue, implying a distressed state.</p>

    <p>Upon draining the excess water and adjusting the containment cell's atmospheric conditions to be more calming, the Nephological Entity gradually returned to its usual form and coloration, signifying a state of tranquility.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Resultant Damage:</h3>
    <p>Significant water damage was recorded in the initial containment cell. No injuries were reported among the personnel, though Field Agent [REDACTED] reported minor waterlogging of equipment.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Recommendations and Actions Taken:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Enhanced containment measures were developed to anticipate and counteract the Nephological Entity's weather manifestations rapidly.</li>
        <li>The installation of advanced drainage systems in the containment cell to handle any further water-based manifestations.</li>
        <li>Introduction of daily communication sessions with the Nephological Entity to monitor its emotional state and ensure its well-being.</li>
        <li>Training sessions for personnel on understanding and responding to the entity's mood-based atmospheric changes.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
    <p>The incident underscored the importance of understanding and catering to the emotional well-being of the contained entities. It also led to the inception of the ARI's "Entity Welfare" program, aimed at ensuring the psychological and emotional stability of all contained aberrations.</p>
