        <p class="aberration-section-large"><strong>ID #:</strong> ABR-002</p>
        <p class="aberration-section-large"><strong>Codename:</strong> "Umbral Enslaver"</p>
        <p class="aberration-section-large"><strong>Threat Classification:</strong> III Hazardous (HZ)</p>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Description:</strong> ABR-002, codenamed "Umbral Enslaver," is a significant anomaly that presents in the form of an entity with unusual optical properties. This aberration appears as a dynamic, fluid-like mass of darkness, approximately 2 meters in height. Upon coming into contact with a host, ABR-002 can disrupt the host's neurological functions, causing changes in behaviour and making them susceptible to external influences. ABR-002 displays high cognitive capacities and adept strategic planning, rendering it a high-risk entity. Its unique optical properties allow it to move inconspicuously in low-light conditions, presenting a considerable risk. The neurological disruption starts upon physical contact between a living being and ABR-002. The impacted hosts show altered behaviours, acting as if directed by an external force.</p>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Containment Protocols and Precautions:</strong> ABR-002 should be secured within a specialized containment chamber made of reinforced titanium alloy, with dimensions of 10 meters by 10 meters by 10 meters. This chamber should have high-intensity floodlights to ensure a brightly lit environment, minimizing ABR-002's optical advantages. Continuous monitoring of the lighting system is critical to ensure its efficiency. Any discrepancies in lighting must be promptly reported and rectified. Security personnel must maintain vigilance outside the containment chamber to inhibit any unauthorized access or potential breaches.</p>
