        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>ID #:</strong> ABR-001</p>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Codename:</strong> "Nephological Entity"</p>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Threat Classification:</strong> Class II: Controllable</p>
        <p class="aberration-section description-text"><strong>Description:</strong> ABR-001, now codenamed "Nephological Entity," is an intriguing humanoid entity standing approximately 1.8 meters in height. It is comprised entirely of densely packed cloud formations that constantly shift and change. The silhouette of Nephological Entity is awe-inspiring when viewed against the backdrop of its containment cell. The entity bears a distinct resemblance to a towering cumulonimbus cloud, with its form subtly changing in alignment with its mood and intentions.</p>
<p class="aberration-section description-text">Despite its ethereal cloud-like composition, Nephological Entity can defy conventional understandings of physics by interacting with physical objects. It possesses the ability to alter its size, density, and weather-creating capabilities, ranging from a light cirrus cloud to a powerful cumulonimbus thunderstorm. The moods and emotions of the Nephological Entity have a direct influence on the type of weather phenomena it manifests, which can include rain, snow, hail, and lightning.</p>
<p class="aberration-section description-text">The Nephological Entity communicates through intricate changes in its cloud formations and colourations, which convey its sentiments and thoughts. With dedicated research, ARI has deciphered a basic form of this visual language, allowing a fundamental level of interaction with the entity.</p>
<p class="aberration-section description-text">The Nephological Entity was discovered following unusual meteorological events in [REDACTED]. The initial encounter resulted in an intense thunderstorm, believed to be a manifestation of the entity's distress. However, after its successful containment and the consistent application of ARI's specialized containment measures, its distress levels have substantially diminished.</p>
<br>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Containment Protocols:</strong> The Nephological Entity is contained within a facility located in the secure sections of the Aberration Research Institute (ARI) global headquarters. The containment cell is equipped with cutting-edge climate control technology, simulating various weather conditions. The aim is to offer a conducive environment that can control and influence the Nephological Entity's inherent capabilities.</p>

<p class="aberration-section">The containment cell is fully surrounded by a robust Faraday cage, ensuring protection against unexpected and potentially harmful weather events the Nephological Entity might produce. Continuous monitoring is upheld by select ARI personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher to ensure safety and stability.</p>

<p class="aberration-section">All alterations in behaviour, physical changes, or shifts in the Nephological Entity's atmospheric makeup must be meticulously documented and immediately reported to the ARI Director.</p>
