        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>ID #:</strong> ABR-004</p>

        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Threat Classification:</strong> III Hazardous (HZ)</p>
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Description:</strong> ABR-004 appears to be a standard desktop computer of an undisclosed brand, manufactured in the year 2010. Upon physical inspection, no deviations from a non-anomalous model can be observed. The system runs an operating system that bears similarities to both Windows 10 and various Linux distributions. However, it is not based on any recognized software architecture.</p>
        <p class="aberration-section">The aberrationâ€™s peculiar properties manifest when the system is turned on and interacted with. ABR-004 has the ability to predict future technological advancements and spontaneously updates itself with hardware and software that is inconsistent with our current understanding of technology. It also stores files and documents purportedly from the future, most of which are encrypted or otherwise restricted.</p>
        <p class="aberration-section">Remarkably, ABR-004 does not require any external power source and functions indefinitely without any noticeable wear or need for maintenance.</p>
        
        <p class="aberration-section"><strong>Containment Protocols and Precautions:</strong> ABR-002 should be secured within a specialized containment chamber made of reinforced titanium alloy, with dimensions of 10 meters by 10 meters by 10 meters. This chamber should have high-intensity floodlights to ensure a brightly lit environment, minimizing ABR-002's optical advantages. Continuous monitoring of the lighting system is critical to ensure its efficiency. Any discrepancies in lighting must be promptly reported and rectified. Security personnel must maintain vigilance outside the containment chamber to inhibit any unauthorized access or potential breaches.</p>
