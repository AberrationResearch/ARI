            <h2>Aberration 1 - Skyward Sentinel</h2>
            <h3>Item Designation: ARI-001</h3>
            <h3>Object Classification: ARI Class II (Directly Manipulable)</h3>
            
            <h3>Containment Protocols:</h3>
            <p>Containment Protocols: ARI-001, now codenamed "Skyward Sentinel," is safely ensconced in a containment facility located deep within the secure corridors of the Aberration Research Institute (ARI) global headquarters. This specialized containment cell is outfitted with state-of-the-art climate control technology, capable of simulating an array of weather conditions, ranging from the serene calm of a summer's day to the fury of a midwinter blizzard. This technological feat aims to provide an appropriate and regulated environment, aiding in the control and manipulation of Skyward Sentinel's innate abilities.
A well-structured Faraday cage encases the entirety of the containment cell, providing a crucial layer of protection against unforeseen and potentially catastrophic weather events that Skyward Sentinel may inadvertently generate. Constant and diligent surveillance of Skyward Sentinel is maintained by select ARI personnel holding Level 3 clearance or higher, ensuring safety and control.
In order to sustain Skyward Sentinel's unique cloud-based form, a specially synthesized nutrient solution must be introduced into the containment cell bi-daily. This scientific breakthrough, achieved by the dedicated efforts of the ARI Nutrition Team, is one of ARI's most closely guarded secrets. All behavioral changes, physical alterations, or shifts in Skyward Sentinel's atmospheric composition must be meticulously recorded and promptly relayed to the ARI Director.
