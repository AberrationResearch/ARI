            <h2>Aberration 1 - Skyward Sentinel</h2>
            <h3>Item Designation: ABR-001</h3>
            <h3>Object Classification: ARI Class II (Directly Manipulable)</h3>
            
            <h3>Containment Protocols:</h3>
            <p>ARI-001, now codenamed "Skyward Sentinel," is safely ensconced in a containment facility located deep within the secure corridors of the Aberration Research Institute (ARI) global headquarters. This specialized containment cell is outfitted with state-of-the-art climate control technology, capable of simulating an array of weather conditions, ranging from the serene calm of a summer's day to the fury of a midwinter blizzard. This technological feat aims to provide an appropriate and regulated environment, aiding in the control and manipulation of Skyward Sentinel's innate abilities.
A well-structured Faraday cage encases the entirety of the containment cell, providing a crucial layer of protection against unforeseen and potentially catastrophic weather events that Skyward Sentinel may inadvertently generate. Constant and diligent surveillance of Skyward Sentinel is maintained by select ARI personnel holding Level 3 clearance or higher, ensuring safety and control.
In order to sustain Skyward Sentinel's unique cloud-based form, a specially synthesized nutrient solution must be introduced into the containment cell bi-daily. This scientific breakthrough, achieved by the dedicated efforts of the ARI Nutrition Team, is one of ARI's most closely guarded secrets. All behavioral changes, physical alterations, or shifts in Skyward Sentinel's atmospheric composition must be meticulously recorded and promptly relayed to the ARI Director.

            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>ARI-001, renamed "Skyward Sentinel," is a captivating humanoid entity standing approximately 1.8 meters in height. Comprised entirely of densely packed cloud formations that ebb and flow, Skyward Sentinel portrays a stunning silhouette against the backdrop of its containment cell. Striking facial features, arms, legs, and an expressive face-like formation materialize within the cloud, giving Skyward Sentinel an uncanny resemblance to a towering cumulonimbus cloud, its features subtly shifting with its mood and intentions.
Skyward Sentinel defies conventional understandings of physics by interacting with physical objects despite its ethereal cloud-like composition. The entity can alter its size, density, and weather-creating capabilities, ranging from a light cirrus cloud to a tempestuous cumulonimbus thunderstorm. The moods and emotions of Skyward Sentinel directly influence the type of weather phenomena it generates, resulting in manifestations of rain, snow, hail, and lightning.
Communicating through a complex series of visual cues, Skyward Sentinel uses changes in cloud formations and colorations to relay its sentiments and thoughts. ARI researchers, with years of dedicated effort, have deciphered a rudimentary form of this visual language, enabling a basic level of interaction with Skyward Sentinel.
The discovery of Skyward Sentinel occurred following a series of inexplicable meteorological anomalies in [REDACTED]. Initial contact with the entity resulted in a violent thunderstorm, attributed to the distress experienced by Skyward Sentinel. However, with the successful containment and consistent implementation of ARI's specialized containment procedures, Skyward Sentinel's distress levels have significantly decreased.
