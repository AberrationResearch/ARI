    <div class="title">Description:</div>
    ABR-002, codenamed "Umbral Enslaver," stands as a paramount concern within the ARI due to its enigmatic and hazardous nature. Manifesting as a fluid-like mass of darkness, it measures roughly 2 meters in height. This entity possesses peculiar optical attributes, allowing it to evade detection effortlessly in low-light conditions. In addition to this, its capability to neurologically manipulate hosts upon contact adds an extra layer of risk. Impacted hosts display significant alterations in behaviour, akin to being controlled by an external entity. Coupled with its evident cognitive abilities and strategic prowess, ABR-002 is classified under the III Hazardous category.

    <div class="title">Containment Protocols and Precautions:</div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chamber Design:</strong> ABR-002 is to be housed within a specialized containment chamber composed of reinforced titanium alloy. Dimensions should stand at 10m x 10m x 10m.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting Systems:</strong> Given ABR-002's predilection for dark areas, the chamber will be equipped with high-intensity floodlights, ensuring a brightly lit environment round-the-clock. This strategy is employed to offset its optical advantage and limit its mobility.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance & Monitoring:</strong> Continuous real-time monitoring of the floodlight system is imperative. In the event of any lighting failures or anomalies, rapid intervention is required. Personnel in charge of monitoring are tasked with overseeing this system and should report any inconsistencies immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Protocols:</strong> High-alert security personnel should station themselves outside the containment chamber. They must be trained to respond to any potential breaches and to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, these personnel should undergo periodic refreshers on ABR-002's characteristics and potential hazards to ensure their safety and the security of the institute.</li>
    </ul>
